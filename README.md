Recoverly, is a web-based application that will help organizations like schools, colleges, universities, fitness centers, corporations, and other public institutions to manage their lost and found items. It will allow admins from the organizations to post the found items for each of their organizations and send email notifications to the organization's members with a secure access code, enabling the members to browse through the found items and claim them. It will also offer real-time analytics on lost and claimed items and introduce a limited time window for collections beyond which those things will be discarded or donated. Recoverly will streamline the recovery process, reduce the workload on the admins, and ensure transparency and efficiency for members reclaiming their belongings.
